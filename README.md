## Introduction

Hi, I'm Joey. Welcome to my GitHub repo for my Sudoku project!

I'm a Software Engineer and, like many, I enjoy the occassional Sudoku puzzle. This is a project that came up one weekend while idly working on a puzzle. I thought to myself, "Why don't I spend this time writing a program to do this for me!" This project then is a realization of that idea - a simple console application to solve Sudokus.
